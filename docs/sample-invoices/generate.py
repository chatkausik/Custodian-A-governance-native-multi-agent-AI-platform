"""Renders 5 real PNG images, each with actual invoice text drawn onto them,
for testing the /submit upload flow. These are real image files that a real
OCR engine has to actually read - not pre-typed ocr_text - covering 5
different real code paths in the pipeline.

Run this INSIDE the sandbox-ocr image, not on the host - the host's Python
has no DejaVuSans-Bold.ttf, so PIL silently falls back to its tiny
non-scalable default bitmap font and ignores the font size entirely, which
in turn (confirmed by testing) makes Tesseract misread digits/punctuation
even though the render looks fine to the eye. The container has the real
font and is what these images are actually tested against anyway:

  docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)/docs/sample-invoices:/out" \
    --entrypoint python3 custodian-sandbox-ocr:latest /out/generate.py

    # Tesseract rather than guessing:
    #  1. dpi=(300, 300) on save - with no DPI metadata Tesseract guesses a
    #     scale and silently mis-segments digits/punctuation (dropped a
    #     zero, "Box" -> "Bo") even on a render that's perfectly readable
    #     to a human eye.
    #  2. A tight canvas close to the actual text. A large mostly-blank
    #     canvas (e.g. 2100x678 for four short lines) confuses Tesseract's
    #     layout analysis into dropping small punctuation like a decimal
    #     point, even with correct DPI - this reproduced consistently and
    #     went away once the canvas stopped being mostly whitespace.
